## Machine Learning:
The machine learning model is nothing but a piece of code; an engineer or data scientist makes it smart through training with data. Its further divided into two categories:

## 1.Supervised Learning:
  In Supervised learning, an AI system is presented with data which is labelled, which means that each data tagged with the correct label.
  The supervised learning is categorized into 2 other categories which are “Classification” and “Regression”.

  ## Classification:
      Classification problem is when the target variable is categorical (i.e. the output could be classified into classes — it belongs to either Class A or B or something else).
      These some most used classification algorithms:
      K-Nearest Neighbor
      Naive Bayes
      Decision Trees/Random Forest
      Support Vector Machine
      Logistic Regression

  ## Regression:
      While a Regression problem is when the target variable is continuous (i.e. the output is numeric).
      These some most used regression algorithms:
      Linear Regression
      Support Vector Regression
      Decision Tress/Random Forest
      Gaussian Progresses Regression
      Ensemble Methods

## 2.Unsupervised Learning:
  In unsupervised learning, an AI system is presented with unlabeled, un-categorized data and the system’s algorithms act on the data without prior training. The output is 
  dependent upon the coded algorithms. Subjecting a system to unsupervised learning is one way of testing AI
  The unsupervised learning is categorized into 2 other categories which are “Clustering” and “Association”.

 ##  Clustering:
      A set of inputs is to be divided into groups. Unlike in classification, the groups are not known beforehand, making this typically an unsupervised task.
      These some most used Clustering algorithms:
      Clustering
      Methods used for clustering are:
      Gaussian mixtures
      K-Means Clustering
      Boosting
      Hierarchical Clustering
      K-Means Clustering
      Spectral Clustering
